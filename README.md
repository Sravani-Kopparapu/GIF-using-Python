# GIF-using-Python
This Python script uses the "imageio" library to create an animated GIF from multiple image files. It loads a sequence of PNG images (nyan-cat1.png, nyan-cat2.png, nyan-cat3.png) into memory, then combines them into a looping GIF (cat.gif) with a frame duration of 0.5 seconds per image. The loop=0 parameter ensures the animation repeats infinitely.

Key Features: 
* Reads multiple image files into a list. 
* Creates a GIF animation from the images.  
* Configurable frame duration and loop settings.

This project is based on the "Codedex" project "Create a GIF with Python" by Sonny LI.
